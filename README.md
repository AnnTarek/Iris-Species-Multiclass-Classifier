# Iris-Species-Multiclass-Classifier

**Objective**
This project aims to develop a PyTorch-based multiclass classification model to accurately classify Iris species.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset of iris-species consists of: <br>
4 features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width. (they are all numerical)<br>
3 classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor , and Iris-virginica. <br>
Total samples: 150 <br>
It's a balanced dataset as well. <br>
<br>
This is the pairplot of the dataset <br>

**Steps to run the code**
1. Download the ipynb file and the dataset file. <br>
2. Upload the notebook on Colab then upload the dataset. <br>
3. Run the whole code to see the results by yourself. <br>

**Dependencies**
-Numpy, Pandas,seaborn, Tensorflow, matplotlib, and sklearn
